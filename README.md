# NanoPlayBoard Android App

Simple Android app to **experiment and play** with the [Arduino Nano PlayBoard][1]. The [Arduino Nano PlayBoard][1] is a board designed by [Antonio Morales][2] and it was designed for an introductory workshop about soldering organized by [HackLab Almería][3]. You can see the gallery of images [here][4].

The [Arduino Nano PlayBoard][1] is an **excellent educational resource** for those students who want **to learn basic electronic and programming**. 

The aim of this Android app is to expand the possibilities of the use of the [Arduino Nano PlayBoard][1], by allowing you to interact with the sensors and actuators available on the board or even interact with other elements connected to Internet.
